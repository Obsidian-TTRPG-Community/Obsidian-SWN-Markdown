# Obsidian SWN in Obsidian Markdown

Introducing an unofficial Obsidian Vault designed to support and ensure compatibility with Kevin Crawford's in-depth tabletop role-playing game, "Stars Without Numbers: Revised Edition." This comprehensive starter vault serves as a valuable resource for players and game masters, offering an organized and accessible repository of game-related content. Immerse yourself in the portion of the universe of "Stars Without Numbers" with this carefully curated vault, designed to enhance your gaming experience and streamline your access to essential information.

You can consider this an abridged and tool-focused version of the free PDF. 

> **Note:** This vault is not a replacement for the free PDF. It is a companion to it. It **does not contain** any of the paid content from the full version of the game.
>
> This vault is also in progress with an conservative completion date of **_2023-08-15_**.

## Requirements

At minimum, you will need the free version of Stars Without Number [Revised Free Edition PDF](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/230009/Stars-Without-Number-Revised-Edition-Free-Version?cPath=36869) for more of the fluff and deeper explanation of rules.

## Additional Disclaimers

Maintaining a repository of this nature is hard work. Thus we are including donation links for all contributors. If you find this vault useful, please consider donating.

Furthermore, any financial compensation should be considered non-commercial use, as it is not our intent to profit from this vault. All donations will be used to support the continued development of this vault and the Obsidian TTRPG community.
